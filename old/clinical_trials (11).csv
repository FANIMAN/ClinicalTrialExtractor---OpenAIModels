Trial1-Info:gen-1728209878-KWnk9ncPNhvZBCWcLap0,1,"Not explicitly stated, but based on the text, it appears to be a protocol for a randomized controlled trial, which suggests it may be a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial.",CNS cancers refer to cancers that affect the brain and spinal cord.,Not explicitly stated,"Not applicable, as this is a study protocol and not a results paper.","Not applicable, as this is a study protocol and not a results paper.",Not specified,Not specified,Not specified,Not specified,Not specified

Trial1-Info:gen-1728209938-pjk4SbgxOxJj6Qmj0T5g,3,Not specified (but likely Phase 3 or 4 given the large sample size and mature data),Invasive Breast Cancer (BC),The German Breast Group (GBG),On-treatment biopsies can predict patients unlikely to achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) post-therapy. Increasing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from baseline to on-treatment biopsy is linked to higher pCR likelihood. Persisting or increased Ki-67 expression is associated with lower pCR probability.,On-treatment biopsies can predict patients unlikely to achieve pCR post-therapy. This could facilitate therapy adjustments for triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancer. They also might offer insights into therapy resistance mechanisms.,Not specified,Not specified,Not specified,Not specified,Not specified
Trial1-Info:gen-1728209953-9iesjago443yKgKZ0hYH,1,"Not specified, but based on the information provided, it is likely Phase 2 or Phase 3, as it is a randomized controlled trial with a reasonable sample size.","The study focuses on breast cancer survivors, specifically those experiencing insomnia symptoms.","Not explicitly stated, but the authors report grants from various organizations, including the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Maryland Department of Health.","The study found that a CBT-I-informed, voice-activated, internet-delivered program improved insomnia symptoms among breast cancer survivors, as measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores.",The study concluded that the CBT-I-informed program is effective in improving insomnia symptoms among breast cancer survivors and has potential for scalability and integration into ambulatory care.,Not specified,Not specified,Not specified,Not specified,Not specified
